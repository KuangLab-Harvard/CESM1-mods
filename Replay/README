In addition to changing SourceMods:

1. Make sure physpkg.F90 in SourceMods/src.cam/ is pointing to the right reanalysis files that you want to replay to.
    Double check the year align is correct if not running FAMIP
    Use physpkg.F90-spcam if you're running SPCAM 
2. Add to user_nl_cam:
    fincl3 = 'SDIFF:I','UDIFF:I','VDIFF:I','QDIFF:I'
    mfilt = 1,1,1
    nhtfrq = 0,-24,-3
(only the third number is important for saving tendencies in mfilt and nhtfrq)
3. Edit env_run.xml:
    RUN_TYPE=STARTUP
    STOP_N=double the length of your desired run
    GLC_NCPL=4
    ROF_NCPL=4
4. Change $CASENAME.run so that --mem-per-cpu=4000
